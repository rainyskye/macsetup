***Please note: This project is mainly for personal use, feel free to fork the repo and change everything necessary to match your preferences, but I won't offer support/feature requests, it is all written in bash to make it easy to tack on extra features, etc. The code is all commented "fairly" well, so it should be easy to figure out what does what.***

### Things to implement/improve:
- [x] Automatically Install [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) if it's not already installed.
- [ ] *(In-Progress)* Automatically install configure CLI tools (e.g: Git, macchina, etc.)
- [x] Setup Finder with custom settings (e.g: Show Hidden Files, Show all File extensions, etc.)
- [x] Set Wallpaper automatically
- [ ] Configure Dock items automatically
- [ ] Set Lock Screen text ("Authorised use only, etc.")
